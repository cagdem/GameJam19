Section 3. Instructions

3.a The Music Player script

The included ’Music Player’ script is a random generative based solution for video game music systems. It is intended to work best when using specifically designed music ‘sections’ played in a random order, although you can experiment with any sounds you like! 

I have written the details into the script for reference however It can be summed up as doing the following actions:

1. Play Preload buffer
2. Play music intro (optional)
3. Choose a random music section from the ones available and play it
4. Wait until the currently playing section is finished
5. Repeat step 3

3.b Setting up the Unity project

3.c Method 1 

1. Import the entire package into your Unity project (minimum compatible editor version is 2022.3)
2. Load the ‘Demo Scene’
3. Enable 1 of the Music Player game objects (e.g. ‘Music Player (Track Name)’)
4. Play (cmd/ctrl + p)

3.d Method 2

1. Import the entire package into your Unity project (minimum compatible editor version is 2022.3)
2. Find the ‘Prefabs’ folder and import your desired Music Player Prefab into the scene (e.g. ‘Music Player (Track Name)’)
3. Play (cmd/ctrl + p)
